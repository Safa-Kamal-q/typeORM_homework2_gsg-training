## ‚ú®Ô∏è Description for this homework:
***Build a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system using TypeORM and Express.js.***

Your application should have the ability to work with Users and their Roles and Permissions (A set of permission belong to a role and the user may have multiple roles), check the diagrams attached for some examples on the Role-Permission architecture 

üìå Your project may contain the following Entities (Tables):
- User
    - Attributes: id (primary key), username, password, email, etc.
    - Relationship: Many-to-Many with Role entity, One-to-One with Profile entity.
- Role
    - Attributes: id (primary key), name (e.g., "admin," "user," "editor").
    - Relationship: Many-to-Many with User entity and Many-to-Many with Permission entity.
- Permission
    - Attributes: id (primary key), name (e.g., "create_post," "edit_user," "delete_comment").
    - Relationship: Many-to-Many with Role entity.
- Profile
    - Attributes: id (primary key), firstName, lastName, dateOfBirth, etc.
    - Relationship: One-to-One with User entity.
<br />

üìå The Project should have the following API endpoints:
- Create User
- Create Permission 
- Create Role (Set permissions of the role while creating the role)
- Assign Role to User
- Get User (with his roles and permissions)
<br />

üìå Requirement:
1. Build a JWT authentication system that works on the username and password of your Role-Permission homework in the previous homework.
    * Your generated JWT token should be 2 weeks valid and contains the following data in it's payload:
        - username
        - email
        - display name

* You should have a login endpoint that validates the username and password and returns a token.
* You should have also any endpoint that validates the token (using middleware) and return the proper status/message.

2.  * Write a unit test to test the Create User function/API which you built in the last homework.
    * Write a unit test to test the Assign Role to User function/API which you built in the last homework.

üìå Submissions
- Create a GitHub repository for your project and commit your code.
- Include a README.md file with instructions on how to set up and run your application.
- Submit the GitHub repository link along with any additional documentation.

## ‚ú®Ô∏è Installation and Usage

> ### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Safa-Kamal-q/typeORM_homework2_gsg-training.git
   
   ```
2. Install the project dependencies:
   ```
    npm install
   
   ```
3. Adding to .env file
create a .env file that contain:
- DB_HOST='localhost'
- DB_PORT= '3306'
- DB_USER_NAME='root'
- DB_PASSWORD=''
- DB_NAME='rbac' #Role-Based Access Control 
- SECRET_KEY= 'Safa1223'

> ### RUN
#### Notes
  1. to run this you must have XAMPP, DBeaver and postman
  2.  you must turn on the XAMPP to connect to DB

---

1. Start the development server:

  ```
    npm run dev
   ```

2. The server should now be running at http://localhost:3006.
3. Use postman to try the code
